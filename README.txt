Welcome to AK's notes on the AESO energy dash, git and general upkeep.

The git-synced folder on AK's HOME computer is under C:\\home\GitRepositories\AESO-data\

To push changes to Github, cd into directory, git status, git commit -m 'message', git push.

To pull; git pull -> the system will ask you to remove local files since it will overwite them, so do so. If you want to do this in terminal, git reset --hard HEAD, git pull

The app.py file can be run in Spyder and you copy+past this address into chrome (http://127.0.0.1:2222/) and the dash should be there!

THE DATA is from here: https://aeso.app.box.com/s/qofgn9axnnw6uq3ip1goiq2ngb11txe5 (AESO CSD Historical database)

>>> I can't upload the files to GitHub since they're too large, unfortunately you'll have to fetch them yourself.
