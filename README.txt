Welcome to AK's notes on the AESO energy dash, git and general upkeep.

The git-synced AESO folder on AK's work computer is under C:\\Documents\GitHub\AESO-data
The git-synced folder on AK's HOME computer is under C:\\home\AaronKirkey\PythonProject\AESO\

To push changes to Github, cd into directory, git status, git commit -m 'message', git push.

To pull; git pull -> the system will ask you to remove local files since it will overwite them, so do so. If you want to do this in terminal, git reset --hard HEAD, git pull

The app.py file can be run in Spyder and you copy+past this address into chrome (http://127.0.0.1:8050/) and the dash should be there!
